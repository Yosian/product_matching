# Product Matching

This project implements product matching using text similarity. It takes a dataset of product names and descriptions, and creates a model to determine if two products are the same based on their text similarity.

## Installation

To run this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- numpy
- nltk
- keras
- scikit-learn


## Usage

1. Open the `repository.py` file in your preferred Python environment.
2. Make sure you have the necessary data for the project. Update the code to import the required data or modify the data import functions accordingly.
3. Run the script. It will perform the following steps:

   - Preprocess the data by cleaning the text and grouping the strings.
   - Tokenize and pad the sequences.
   - Train a model to predict product similarity using embeddings and cosine similarity.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.
   - Print the accuracy of the model.
